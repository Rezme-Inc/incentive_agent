<anythingllm-thinking>
I need to conduct comprehensive research on hiring incentive programs in Illinois. Let me use my extended thinking to organize this systematically and avoid the pitfalls mentioned in the instructions.

First, let me think through the known issues from the Illinois test:
1. Duplicates - I need to list each program ONCE even if it serves multiple populations
2. Hallucinations - I must verify legislation actually passed
3. WOTC status - It's EXPIRED as of 12/31/2025, not active
4. Missing URLs - Need to find official .gov sources
5. Non-incentives - Flag procurement preferences clearly
6. Value errors - Be careful about policy limits vs cash value

Let me start by organizing what I know from the web context provided:

**Federal Programs with State Interface:**
1. Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) - EXPIRED 12/31/2025
2. Federal Bonding Program 
3. WIOA On-the-Job Training
4. DoD SkillBridge
5. VA programs (VR&E, NPWE, etc.)

**Illinois State Programs:**
From the web context, I can see references to:
1. Illinois tax credit programs through IDES
2. Credit for Wages Paid to Returning Citizens (mentioned in the tax bulletin)
3. Enterprise Zone programs
4. DCEO incentives and tax credits

Let me think through each systematically:

**WOTC Status Critical Issue:**
The instructions are very clear - WOTC expired December 31, 2025. I must not mark this as active. The web context shows Wisconsin and other states still have WOTC pages, but the federal authorization expired. I need to mark this correctly.

**Enterprise Zone Complexity:**
I see references to multiple enterprise zones - West Regional Enterprise Zone, Chicago enterprise zones, etc. I need to determine if these are separate programs or one program with geographic variations. From my understanding, Illinois has one Enterprise Zone program administered at the state level with local zones. I should list this once, not create duplicates for each zone.

**Duplicates Prevention Strategy:**
I need to be very careful here. If I find a program that serves veterans, disabled individuals, and ex-offenders, I list it ONCE with all populations noted, not three separate entries.

Let me work through the jurisdictional levels:

**FEDERAL PROGRAMS WITH ILLINOIS STATE INTERFACE:**

1. **Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)**
- Status: EXPIRED 12/31/2025 - this is critical to get right
- Multiple target populations
- Federal tax credit, Illinois IDES certifies eligibility

2. **Federal Bonding Program** 
- Active federal program
- State employment agencies deliver
- $5,000-$25,000 policy limit (NOT cash value to employer)

3. **WIOA On-the-Job Training**
- Federal funding, local workforce boards administer
- Wage reimbursement typically 50-75%

4. **DoD SkillBridge**
- Active duty transitioning service members
- Employer pays $0, DoD pays salary
- Value is opportunity cost

**ILLINOIS STATE PROGRAMS:**

From the web context, I can identify:

1. **Credit for Wages Paid to Returning Citizens**
- The tax bulletin FY 2026-08 mentions changes to this credit
- This appears to be an active Illinois tax credit
- Targets justice-impacted individuals

2. **Illinois Enterprise Zone Tax Credits**
- Multiple references in web context
- Jobs credit component for hiring
- Administered through DCEO
- One program, multiple geographic zones

3. **Other DCEO Incentives**
- The web context shows DCEO has incentives and tax credits
- Need to identify specific hiring-related programs

**LOCAL PROGRAMS:**

I see references to:
- Chicago enterprise zone programs
- County workforce programs
- Various municipal economic development programs

Let me now think about programs I might be missing:

**Commonly Overlooked Programs to Search For:**
1. Illinois apprenticeship tax credits
2. State disability employment programs through DHS/DRS
3. Illinois veterans programs through IDVA
4. Transitional jobs programs
5. Local workforce board specific programs
6. County reentry programs

**Status Verification Strategy:**
I need to be very careful about program status. The HB3068 reference in the web context appears to be related to the returning citizens credit - I need to verify if this passed and is active.

**Geographic Trigger Complexity:**
This was noted as confusing in the Illinois test. I need to clearly specify for each program:
- Does candidate home address matter?
- Does work site location matter?
- Does employer HQ location matter?

For most state programs, work site location in Illinois will matter. For federal programs, it varies.

**Value Calculation Nuance:**
I need to be careful about:
- Tax credits: actual dollar amounts
- Insurance programs: policy limits are NOT cash value to employer
- Wage offsets: opportunity cost value
- Support services: non-quantifiable

Let me now start building the comprehensive list, being very careful about duplicates and accuracy:
