## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

I identified **8 federal programs** that provide direct or indirect hiring incentives for employers who hire individuals from targeted populations. The programs span multiple federal agencies and offer various types of benefits including tax credits, wage reimbursements, risk mitigation, and procurement preferences.

**Key Observations:**
- The expiration of WOTC on December 31, 2025, represents a significant loss of the most widely-used federal hiring incentive
- Federal Bonding Program remains a valuable risk mitigation tool for justice-impacted populations
- WIOA continues to provide substantial on-the-job training reimbursements
- Veterans-focused programs offer multiple pathways for employer incentives
- Several programs target overlapping populations, providing potential stacking opportunities

**Confidence Assessment:**
- High confidence: 3 programs (WOTC, Federal Bonding, ERC)
- Medium-High confidence: 2 programs (VA VR&E OJT, DOD SkillBridge)  
- Medium confidence: 3 programs (WIOA OJT, HUD Section 3, SCSEP)

This analysis focused exclusively on federal programs as requested. Illinois employers should consult with local workforce development boards and federal agency representatives for current program availability and application procedures, particularly given the recent expiration of WOTC.

## PROGRAM GAPS AND LIMITATIONS

**Notable Finding:** Unlike many other states, Illinois appears to have limited local-level hiring incentive programs beyond enterprise zones. Most comprehensive programs operate at the state level through agencies like IDES and DCEO.

**Enterprise Zone Dominance:** The majority of local hiring incentives are delivered through the enterprise zone program structure, which provides a framework for local jurisdictions to offer tax incentives for job creation.

**Federal Program Interface:** While federal programs like WOTC (expired 12/31/2025) and Federal Bonding exist, these are administered through state agencies rather than having distinct local components in Illinois.

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

1. **Limited Public Documentation:** Many local programs lack comprehensive online documentation, requiring direct contact with municipal economic development offices.

2. **Enterprise Zone Variability:** Each enterprise zone may have unique incentive structures that are not fully documented online.

3. **Program Updates:** Some programs may have been modified or discontinued since last public documentation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. Contact Chicago Department of Planning and Development for complete TIF hiring incentive inventory
2. Reach out to individual enterprise zone administrators for specific benefit amounts
3. Survey major Illinois cities (Rockford, Peoria, Springfield, Aurora) for undocumented local programs
4. Investigate workforce development board contracts at the local level for employer incentives

**Total Programs Identified:** 8 distinct local programs
**Primary Geographic Coverage:** Chicago, Cook County, and various enterprise zones throughout Illinois
**Most Common Program Type:** Tax credits through enterprise zone structures
